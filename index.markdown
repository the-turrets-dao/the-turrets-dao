![logo](turret-dao.png) `The Turrets DAO is about Stellar Turrets one can trust!`


<p>The Turrets DAO brings together Stellar Smart Contract Developers and Stellar Turret Server Operators.</p>

`Our mission is to build a network of Turrets running smart contracts that one can trust!`

<p>Developers who provide trusted smart contracts are rewarded. Server operators who run the smart contracts benefit from increased security.</p>



### This is how it will work:  
<p>Devs upload their smart contracts for audit. These must first be reviewed (audited) by other devs and members of the DAO to be approved. </p>

<p>Members who have reviewed the smart contracts vote with their reputation tokens. As soon as approved, the contract is deployed by the servers operators (also DAO Members). </p>

<p>The more the contract is used the higher its security is rated and therefore the more turret servers will trust and run it. </p>

<p>The dev of the contract earns reputation tokens and DOA tokens. The DAO tokens are freely tradable and used to govern the DAO. Operators that run the secure contracts therefore must pay a small amount of DAO tokens with each execution to the developer and to the DAO. The more the smart contract is used the more DAO and reputation tokens the dev will earn.</p>

<p>Reputation tokens can also be earned by reviewing new contracts. The more the contract is used the more tokens.</p>

<p>Participating servers are audited and listed, so that one can easily find trustable servers.</p>

### More: 
<p>The smart contracts used to build this DAO will be available to the public and will help other DAOs to be created using the Stellar Network.
